Error handling
    added catch block after axios request:
        - initially getting data
        - adding new todo
        - editing todo
        - deleting todo
        - toggling state of todo

Alerts for CRUD operations
    added alerts with custom message:
        - adding new todo
        - edditing todo
        - deleting todo
        - toggling the state of todo

    there is no alert when initialy fetching data, or fetching them after some change, since it seems redundant
