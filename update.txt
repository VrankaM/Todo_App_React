Error handling
    added catch block after axios request:
        - initially getting data
        - adding new todo
        - editing todo
        - deleting todo
        - toggling state of todo

Alerts for CRUD operations
    added alerts with custom message:
        - adding new todo
        - edditing todo
        - deleting todo
        - toggling the state of todo

    there is no alert when initialy fetching data, or fetching them after some change, since it seems redundant

Search on keyup
    added 1000ms timer that resets after each new keypress 

Fetching 10 todos initially, then additional 5 when scrolling to the end of list
    limit on fetching data is applied through url parameters
    limit number is initially 10, this value is stored in redux store
    function to increment limit has three conditions
        - footer element must be visible, that means that user has scrolled to the bottom of the list
        - number of downloaded todos must be less than the limit
        - variable in redux store named fetchFinished must be true
            this variable is true only if all todos have been rendered
            (after first load of the page, footer is visible for a short moment, this variable prevents incrementing limit in that scenario) 
    function increment will increment limit in redux store by 5
    after switching to page "active" or "completed", useEffect fires a reset function, that resets limit to 10 and fetchFinished to false

Sort todos from newest to oldest
    adding url parameters from mockapi docs for unknown reason didnt work
    // sortBy=createdAt&order=desc / sortBy=createdAt&order=asc
